# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classifier (PyTorch)

This is a beginner-friendly deep learning project that builds a simple **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **PyTorch** to classify images of **cats and dogs**.

---

## 🧠 What This Project Does

- Loads and transforms image data using `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder`
- Trains a small CNN model to classify images into `cat` or `dog`
- Evaluates model performance and makes predictions
- Works efficiently on a typical laptop (8GB RAM)
